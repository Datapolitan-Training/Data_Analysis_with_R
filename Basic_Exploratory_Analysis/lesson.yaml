  Output: Hello and welcome to Data Analysis with R! This second lesson is intended to get you started with the basics of exploring a dataset in R.

- Class: text
  Output: We'll begin by exploring a basic dataset that's built into R so we can explore basic syntax and commands in R.

- Class: text
  Output: If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related
    to R, you can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of resources
    (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on your setup).
    Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.

  Output: To give R a command, we start with the function name and put whatever we're calling the function on in parenthesis, like this "command(data)".

  Output: To get started, you need to view the data using the "View" command. The dataset is called "faithful." Based on the basic format of R commands (command(data), try to open it now with this command.
  CorrectAnswer: View(faithful)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(faithful')
  Hint: We start an R command with the function (in this case "View") and our data is called "faithful." Try putting these together with the "faithful" in parenthesis.
